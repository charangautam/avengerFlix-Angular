## Objective ##

Using Angular, build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database), with supporting documentation.

## User Stories ##
- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies

## Key Features ##
- Your app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an
account.
- Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.
- Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where
additional movie details will be displayed. The single movie view will contain the following
additional features:
    - A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the
director of that particular movie will be displayed.    
    - A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that
particular genre of the movie will be displayed

- The application must be written in Angular (version 9 or later)
- The application requires the latest version of Node.js and npm package
- The application must contain user registration and login forms
- The application must be designed using Angular Material
- The application's codebase must contain comments using Typedoc
